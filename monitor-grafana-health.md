To monitor the health of a managed Grafana workspace, you can use CloudWatch Metrics and set up alarms based on specific metrics. Here's an example configuration using Terraform:

    Configure CloudWatch Metrics:

hcl

resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "grafana_health_alarm" {
  alarm_name          = "grafana_health_alarm"
  comparison_operator = "LessThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods  = "1"
  metric_name         = "HealthCheckStatus"
  namespace           = "AWS/ManagedGrafana"
  period              = "300"
  statistic           = "Average"
  threshold           = "1"
  alarm_description   = "Managed Grafana workspace health check failed"
  alarm_actions       = [] // Specify any actions to be taken when the alarm state is triggered
  dimensions = {
    WorkspaceId = "your-grafana-workspace-id"
  }
}

In the above example, we configure a CloudWatch Metric Alarm to monitor the health of the managed Grafana workspace. The grafana_health_alarm alarm is triggered when the HealthCheckStatus metric falls below the threshold of 1. You can specify the appropriate threshold based on your requirements.

Make sure to replace "your-grafana-workspace-id" with the actual ID of your managed Grafana workspace in the Terraform configuration.

By deploying this Terraform configuration, you'll be able to monitor the health of your managed Grafana workspace using CloudWatch Metrics. If the health check fails, the alarm state will be triggered, and you can define actions to be taken accordingly.
